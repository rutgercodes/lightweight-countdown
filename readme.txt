== Description ==

The Lightweight Countdown Timers plugin lets you create simple countdown timers and place them anywhere with a shortcode. The plugin ads a timers section in the main menu. Here you can create multiple timers with a few simple settings. When saved, the shortcodes to show the timer in the frontend are showed. 

Additionally you can use a shortcode to show content only before, or after the deadline of the timer.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I add multiple countdown timers? =

Yes, you can create as many timers as you like. Each timer gets their own unique shortcode.

= Are the countdown timers styled by the plugin? =

No, the plugin only displays the countdown text. Because the plugin uses shortcodes, you can use your theme to style the timers.


== Other Notes ==

The timers always use the timezone set in your WordPress setting, keep this in mind when setting the deadline.
